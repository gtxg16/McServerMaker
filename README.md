# McServerMaker
Automatically creates a minecraft server for you.

Very simple. Run the program, whether you use the exe, or the .sh, or just use good ol' python.
First prompt is that if you agree to the Minecraft EULA.
Second prompt is server type, third version, then download.
Fourth is ram, then start.

Easy.


**Known issues:**
Snapshots don't work, at least on my pc.
